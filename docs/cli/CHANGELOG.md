## [1.0.0-alpha.12.3] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- Changed message when displaying loaded sources
  - From: "🔍 Loaded {SourcesCount} source OpenAPI docs from config:"
  - To:   "🔍 Loaded {SourcesCount} OpenAPI definitions from config:"
- Changed message when koalescing is finished
  - From: "✅ Koalesced OpenAPI written to:"
  - To:   "✅ Koalesced OpenAPI definition written to:"


### Fixed

- **Display FilePath:** FilePath is now displayed among the source list when used as a source.

## [1.0.0-alpha.12.2] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **LTS Targeting:** The CLI project now targets both **.NET 8.0 (LTS)** and **.NET 10.0 (LTS)**.
  - Users with .NET 10 will use the optimized .NET 10 build.
  - Users with .NET 8 or .NET 9 will automatically use the .NET 8 build.

### Fixed

- **Runtime Compatibility:** Fixed installation failure ("Settings file not found") on environments running .NET 8 or .NET 9. The tool now correctly supports these runtimes via multi-targeting.

---

## [1.0.0-alpha.12.1] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Packaging Strategy:** The CLI package is now **self-contained**. It bundles the `Koalesce.Core` and `Koalesce.OpenAPI` dependencies (v1.0.0-alpha.12) internally.

### Fixed

- **Installation Error:** Fixed a critical issue where `dotnet tool install` would fail with "Settings file 'DotnetToolSettings.xml' was not found".

## [1.0.0-alpha.12] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Core Update:** Upgraded `Koalesce` core libraries to version **1.0.0-alpha.12**.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes (via Core libraries)

- **Configuration Validation:** The CLI will now **fail to start** if the `appsettings.json` contains duplicate URLs or FilePaths in the `Sources` list. Previously, duplicates might have been processed redundantly.
- **OpenAPI 3.1.0 Output:** Due to the upgrade to `Microsoft.OpenApi` 2.0, the generated output document may now utilize OpenAPI 3.1.0 features. Downstream tools that only support OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0 may need updates.

## [1.0.0-alpha.11] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **Core Update:** Upgraded `Koalesce` core libraries to version **1.0.0-alpha.11**.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes (via Core libraries)

- **Security Logic:** Removed optional support for mixed security schemes. The system now always preserves downstream security schemes by design.

## [1.0.0-alpha.10] - 2026-01-22

### Changed

- **Core Update:** Upgraded `Koalesce` core libraries to version **1.0.0-alpha.10**.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes (via Core libraries)

- **Schema Naming Strategy (Output Change):** The logic for resolving conflicting schema names is now deterministic. Sources with `VirtualPrefix` will **always** prefix their schemas (e.g., `Inventory_Product`), changing the output structure.
